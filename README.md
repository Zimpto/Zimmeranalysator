# Zimmeranalysator - Room Analyzer üå°Ô∏èüíßüåûüåø

**Zimmeranalysator** is a custom-designed circuit board with the ESP32 for real-time environmental monitoring in indoor spaces. It tracks humidity, temperature, light intensity, and CO‚ÇÇ levels, logging data to a microSD card and hosting a local website to display the latest readings. The device also offers visual feedback to encourage ventilation for optimal indoor air quality.

## Features

- **Environmental Data Logging**: Measures and records humidity, temperature, light, and CO‚ÇÇ levels onto a microSD card.
- **Wi-Fi Web Server**: Hosts a website on the local network displaying real-time sensor data with refresh capabilities.
- **Multi-Room Navigation**: Easily access data from other Zimmeranalysator devices in nearby rooms.
- **Time Synchronization**: Weekly sync with an NTP server to ensure accurate timestamps.
- **Visual Alerts**: LEDs for quick feedback on air quality:
  - üü° Yellow: Maintenance mode
  - üîµ Blue: High humidity
  - üî¥ Red: High CO‚ÇÇ levels
  - üü¢ Green: Optimal air quality
